CRITICAL UX + LOCALIZATION + ONBOARDING FIXES REQUIRED

LANGUAGE SELECTION BEFORE APP ENTRY (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------------------------
1) The user MUST choose the app language BEFORE entering the main app.
2) Add a Language Selection screen as the FIRST screen on app launch.
3) Supported languages:
   - English
   - Arabic
4) The user cannot proceed into the app without selecting a language.
5) Save the selected language in persistent storage (local storage / async storage).
6) On next app launch, auto-load the previously selected language.

START SCREEN BUTTON FIX
-----------------------
7) The white button on the start screen MUST have clear text.
8) Button text must be localized:
   - English: "Start Learning"
   - Arabic:  "ابدأ التعلّم"
9) Do NOT display any unlabeled buttons.

FULL HOME SCREEN LOCALIZATION
-----------------------------
10) When Arabic is selected, the ENTIRE home screen must be translated, including:
    - App subtitle ("Learn Dutch step by step")
    - Level
    - Total XP
    - Progress
    - Progress to next level
    - Vocabulary Sections
    - Section names
    - "Start Learning"
    - "Locked"
    - Progress counters (e.g. 0/50)

QUIZ LANGUAGE LOGIC (STRICT)
---------------------------
11) Quiz behavior must depend on selected language:
    - English mode:
      • Show `word_en`
      • Question text: "What is this in Dutch?"
    - Arabic mode:
      • Show `word_ar`
      • Question text: "ما معنى هذه الكلمة باللغة الهولندية؟"

12) Answer options MUST ALWAYS remain in Dutch (`word_nl`).
13) The correct answer is always the matching `word_nl`.

LOCALIZATION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
----------------------------------
- Do NOT hardcode English text.
- Use localization files (e.g. en.json / ar.json).
- Arabic layout MUST support RTL.
- Language switching must re-render the entire UI immediately.

GOAL
----
The app must feel fully native in Arabic or English,
starting from the first screen,
with clear language choice and correct learning logic.
