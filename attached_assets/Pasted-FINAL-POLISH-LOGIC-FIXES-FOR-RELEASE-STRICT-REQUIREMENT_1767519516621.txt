FINAL POLISH & LOGIC FIXES FOR RELEASE (STRICT REQUIREMENTS)

Please implement the following fixes and improvements carefully.
Do NOT change existing core logic unless explicitly stated.

================================
1) LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY (AR / EN)
================================
- If the user selects Arabic as the app language:
  • ALL texts must be displayed in Arabic.
  • This includes the "Section Complete" screen.
- Currently, the final result screen appears in English even when Arabic is selected.
- Fix this so the result screen fully respects the selected language.

================================
2) USER DISPLAY NAME
================================
- On the Profile screen:
  • Do NOT display the Apple private relay email.
  • Instead, display a friendly username (e.g. "User" or "Learner").
- If no custom name exists, use a default display name.
- Never show the email address in the UI.

================================
3) QUIZ PROGRESS PERSISTENCE (IMPORTANT)
================================
- User progress MUST be saved even if the user presses the "Back" button.
- When the user returns to the same section:
  • The quiz should resume from the saved progress.
- Progress should only be reset if:
  • The user manually restarts the section.
- Do NOT reset progress automatically on back navigation.

================================
4) SECTION COMPLETION VALIDATION (UPDATED RULE)
================================
- Each section contains 30 questions.
- A section should ONLY be marked as completed if:
  • The user answers at least 15 questions correctly.
- If the user answers fewer than 15 correct:
  • The section must NOT be completed.
  • The next section must remain locked.
  • Show a failure or retry state instead of "Section Complete".

(Current issue: sections are marked complete with very low scores.)

================================
5) SECTION UNLOCKING WITH XP
================================
- Some sections are locked.
- If the user wants to unlock a locked section:
  • Require spending XP points.
  • Cost: 300 XP per locked section.
- Deduct XP immediately upon unlocking.
- If the user does not have enough XP:
  • Prevent unlocking.
  • Show a clear message to the user.

================================
GENERAL RULES
================================
- Do NOT introduce new features.
- Do NOT change UI design unless required for logic fixes.
- Do NOT break existing navigation.
- Keep logic deterministic and predictable.
- This is final release polishing before App Store submission.

GOAL:
Ensure correct language behavior, persistent user progress,
fair section completion logic (15 correct answers minimum),
and proper XP-based section unlocking.
